# Notes
A compilation of notes on C, Python, C++ and more


Before the Code
    
    Background on Unix
    - Unix supports a hierarchical file system.
    - Unix supports a pipe: where the output of one program becomes the input of another. 
    - There are over 200 UNIX utilities, tools to accomplish routine tasks without writing new routines. 
    - There are over 60 system calls which are functions written in C. These calls are the heart of the UNIX system. 
    - Finally, there are a number of UNIX functions available, which are an extension of the basic UNIX system. 
    - The system calls can only be accessed from C. The same can be said of the library functions, even though the latter is AVAILABLE on systems other than UNIX. 
    
    Versions of the Unix System
    - Unix is comprised of:
        1. Run time system: The kernel and most utilities.
        2. Software development system.
        
        
Files and Directories

    The Directory System
    - The Directory system is comprised of data files, device files and directory files.
    - Data files are a set of information (such as data or program) that was created using the text editor or by running a program. This includes everything we write through the vi editor, e.g "vi program1.c" and other IDEs such as CodeLite, CodeBlocks etc. /*Actually, we're not too sure what the CodeBlock things are */
    - Device Files are files which aren't stored on the disk at all, but represents a "peripheral device", such as the terminal, disk, tape or printer. /*Not sure what their role is yet, need to check*/
    - Directory Files are files which maintain a list of all files assigned to it, including data files, device files and other directory files(the offspring directories, or children, are known as subdirectories). 
    - The whole directory system for UNIX (which also works on mac) is based on the idea that we start at the root directory. This is denoted by: /  . From the root, we then have a variety of other directories or even data and device files. Each directory may then have data files, device files, or even more directories, and so on.
    - NOTE: ONLY DIRECTORY FILES CAN HAVE CHILDREN. 
    - Definition: Children are any files which are underneath or within another directory file. 
    

    
    
  


The Basics

    IDEs - Compilers
    - At the moment, you are editing this "code", ie, a bunch of text, through an Integrated Development Environment(IDE).
    The IDE is essentially a program which is comprised of a source code editor (so you can edit the code which actually runs in your
    program), builder automation, and debugger.
    - The IDE may also contain what is called a COMPILER, which is a program that converts your source code to machine language. The
    compiler is required because the actual computer or machine doesn't recognise the code in C, Python etc, instead, it can only read
    what is known as machine language, ie, a whole heap of 0s and 1s.
	
    
    
    Projects -> Files
    - Overall, all our programs, ie, websites, games etc, start off as projects.
    - Source code: In each project, we have different files. One of these files will contain what is called the source code, and this file is called the
    source file. This file contains the majority of the code which you need to edit.
    - Header: However, there are also files which often contain the required data and functions used in a source file. These files typically include:
    
        1. stdio.h
        2. math.h
        3. stdlib.h
	4. string.h
        
    The three of these files are already included in all C programs. /*Check this*/. The first file stands for "standard input output".
    The second files is self-explanatory (contains maths functions, variables etc.). /*The third files is currently unknown*/
    - Note that all of the above files have a .h at the end, which indicates that these files are to be included in the source file as the
    header files.
    - Also note that all projects themselves are saved under a single folder with the name of whatever you called the project. The project folder seems to be able to
    be saved anywhere. 
    
    Creating a New File
    - Once a source of constant mystery, the notion of creating a new project is now no longer shrouded in mystery: All you do, to run a new program, is click twice
    on the project in the workspace pane on the left. 
    
    Output
    - Typically, /*As far as we've seen*/ the majority of output for C is in fact displayed on the TERMINAL of the computer, rather than
    on a website or app or console. /*In fact, perhaps the terminal is the console.*/
    

Identifiers
	- Identifiers in C are a sequence of any finite length (but greater than or equal to 1) consisting of letters, numbers and underscores. However, all identifiers must begin with either a letter or an underscore. 
	- Identifiers can be used for the following:
		- Variable names
		- Function names
		- Constant Names
		- Names for Type I and Type II UNIX C functions
		- Keywords


	Keywords
		- Keywords are words which are reserved for use in a predefined context. 
		- For example, the “while” word can only be used for iteration and testing. It won’t allow the user to set initial conditions in its testing. Likewise, the word “else” can only be used after the user has already used an “if” statement. 

Expressions and Statements
	- Expressions are any valid combination of constants, variables, operators and function calls. 
	- Statements are expressions terminated by a semicolon. 
    
Data Types

	Arrays
	- Arrays are collection of elements of the same data type within the computer’s RAM. 
	- 

    sizeof() Operator
    - This operator, when you input some variable or value inside the brackets, gives you the space occupied by that union, type or struct.
    
    
 Type Casting
    - When we tell C to handle a particular variable as a particular type
    - To do so, we use the following notation:
            
            [type1] [variable] = [type1 value];
            [type2] [new_variable] = ([type2]) variable

    For example:
            float new;
            int i = 10;
            new = (float) i
            //new is assigned the value 10.0

	- Note also, we often use casting in the actual calculations themselves if need be through the same process. For example, if we want to find the a more accurate value of 5/2, we may use:

		int a = 5;
		float b = (float(a))/2;

	And the value of b will now be 2.500000. Note that we could’ve also used: 

		(float)a/2

	Conversions
		- We will often want to evaluate expressions involving variables of mixed data types. 
		- If we don’t convert the types explicitly, then a process known as “implicit coercion” takes place. 
		- In such cases, the lower type is always converted to the highest type according to the following hierarchy:

			char or short -> int -> unsigned -> long - > unsigned long -> float -> double

		- The above process is known as widening. Alternatively, we can also shorten the expression (convert the expression type and data types to lower values). For example:

			int i = 9;
			float f = 3.1415;
			i = i/((int)f);
			printf(“%d\n”,I);
			
			/*Output: 3*/
	
		The above example outputs three because in our evaluation for i, we used the integer form of variable “f”, 3 (truncated from 3.1415) so 9/3 == 3.
	

Starting from Scratch
    
    IDE
    - Download an IDE from the internet. Some good editors include:
    
        1. Visual Code (Microsoft)
        2. CodeLite.
        3. CodeBlocks /*This one actually seems kinda dodgy. Well, not dodgy, just fucking hate it.*/
        
    That's about it! Otherwise, you don't really need anything else to create, edit and implement your own code!

	Terminal
	- As an alternative to IDEs from the internet, the most basic way we can edit code is through what's known as the "Terminal", which is inbuilt for all Apple Products (as far as we know). 
	- To get started with terminal:
		1. simply search up terminal by clicking on the search symbol (magnifying glass) in the top right hand corner of the Mac. Then, to simply create a new file for source code, enter the command:

		vi new_file.c

	 	2.This should take you to a bit of an interesting space, where there are a bunch of ~ signs all around. At this point, it's normal if you can't actually write any code.
		3. To start writing code, press the i button, and away you go!
		4. To exit your code AND save it, press the "esc" button to exit input mode, then press "ZZ" (That's right, just press Shift-Z once, then Shift Z again). This should take you back to your original terminal window. 
		5. For C programs, we have to the compile the code we just wrote (more explanations on this later). To do so, we type in

			cc [file_name]

		6. To then execute the code (ie, make it work, and do the stuff we want), we have to type in the command:

			./a.out

		7. Your program should now be working fine. 

	- Note: To clarify, when you get started on terminal, you have what's known as your "command line", where you type commands in. Your "command line" will look like this:

		Jesses-iMac: Documents JZ$ 

	Whatever you type in after the dollar sign are the commands. 



Command Line Commands

	Program


	Manual
	- Inbuilt into every Unix system (we think /*check this*/) is a user manual, which includes 5 main sections on how the system works and the various commands you can use. 
	- To see the manual entry on a particular UNIX C function, just type in (at the command line, regardless of where you are in terms of working directories)

		man [command]
	- However, because there are often different versions of the same command, you often have to type

		man [manual-section] [command or whatever you’re looking for
]
	
	To specify which command you actually want. 



UNIX C Functions
	
	Type I /*system calls?*/
	- Type I UNIX C functions are inbuilt with the UNIX systems made available for all C programs. 
	- This means that Type I UNIX C functions do not require a preprocessor directive to be included in your code. 

	Type I Common Functions
	- chmod(file_name, file_mode): the chmod function has two inputs: file_name, which  is a pointer to the file name, and file mode, which is a number corresponding to a certain file mode. The types of file modes are: 
		0: No permission
		1: Execute
		2: Write
		4: Read

	Notice that we can then have values which designate some combination of these permission modes. For example, 

		1 + 2 + 4 = 7

	So a permission code of 7 means that we are able to read, write and execute a particular file. Likewise:

		2 + 4 = 6
	
	So a permission code of 6 means that we are able to read and write to a file, but we're not able to execute it. 
	Note: It's important to note that we also have a UNIX command which also allows us to change the permission of a particular file. The command is implemented through:


		chmod [a][b][c] [file_name]
	
	Here, note that a, b and c represent the permission code for the user, group and others respectively. For example, if we have a permission code of 761, this would imply that the user can read, write and execute the file (7 = 1 + 2+4), the members of the group can read and write to the file (6 = 2+4) while others can only execute the file. Alternatively, one can also set the permission through the notation:

		chmod u = rwx, g = rwx, o=rwx [file_name]
	
	Though obviously you don't actually have to put rwx for all of them, only the permission types that you desire. Also, if you want a certain entity to have no permission whatsoever in this format, just leave the permission blank. For example, if we want others to have no permission whatsoever to a file, we use

		chmod u = rwx, g = rwx, o = [file_name]




	- perror(const char * s): The perror function returns a pointer to the appropriate error message. The perror function searches for the error message (e.g "File not in directory) corresponding to the current value of the global variable errno. perror then prints this message preceded by "[s]: ". So, for example, if we were to use a system call which failed due to the file not being in the directory, and we had:

		perror("access")

	The output would be:

		access: File not a directory

	- To use perror, we don’t need any preprocessor directives because error is a system call. 



Input
	- One way of giving an EOF or stopping scanf as far as we can see if by pressing the “esc” button, which shows up as “^[“. 


    
The Program

    Preprocessor
    - In all programs (as we are currently aware of), we require a set of preprocessor directives which create the framework for the rest
    of the code in the source file.
    - The preprocessor directives are:
    
        1. #include
        2. #define
        
    The #include PPD(Preprocessor directive) tells the compiler to include the file at the end of the include command. For example:
    
        #include <stdio.h>
        or
        #include "Physics_constants.h"
        
    Tells the compiler to include the standard input-ouput header file. As to why for something such as the standard input output file
    can be put in the /*vectors*/ while the Physics_constants header file had to be put in quotation marks is unknown. Currently, its thought that the standard header
    files provided by the C system can use the vector quotations. 
    - The #define directive defines a certain /*variable?*/ throughout the program. For example
    
        #define SPEED_OF_LIGHT 3.00*pow(10,8)
        
    Here, we're defining the /*variable?*/ SPEED_OF_LIGHT as having a value of 3.00*(10^8). Note that since we can't actually use the
    notation 10^8 /*for reasons unknown*/ we are forced to use the index function 
        
    
    Functions
    - Functions are just lines of code which do something with an argument.
    - Functions are implemented as follows:
    
        1. Declare the function at the beginning of the file, even before the main function:
        
            type_of_function function_name(type_of_argument argument_name)
            
        2. Specify the code inside the function after the main function:
        
            type_of_function function_name(type_of_argument argument_name) {
            
                code;
            
            }
            
    - NOTE: If we don't want the function to return anything, the function type should be "void", ie,
    
        void function_name(argument) {
            code
        }
        
    
    
    
    Semicolons
    - In general, semicolons are only used after statements or declarations or commands, ie, the function printf is a command to print the control string.
    - On the other hand, conditional statements such as if-then, or while, do not require semicolons after the main block of code. 
    
    
Data Types

	Note: If you have a character, say ‘A’, and you try to do arithmetic with it, you can, because ‘A’ is really just a number as well (corresponding to it’s ASCII value). 

	- Likewise, if you try to print a number as a character, it will, as long as the number is within the possible range associated with a single character. That is, because a single character is 8 bits long, we have 2^8 possible characters, each corresponding to some unique combination of 8 1’s and 0’s(binary number), our largest possible number is 255 (although there are 256 possible combinations…see the proof in a later section). 


	Arrays
	- Arrays are collections of values of the same data type organised under the same name. 
	- Arrays are typically declared through:

		
		[data type of array elements] [array_name][n];

		Note that here, n refers to the number of elements in the array. 

	- Arrays can be initialised through the following format:

		[data type of array elements] [array_name] [n] = {element_1, element_2….element_n};

	Likewise, note that for multidimensional arrays, we can initialise arrays through:

		[data type] [array_name][m][n] = {

		{x_11,x_12,…x_1n},
		{x_21,x_22,…x_2n],
		.
		.
		.
		{x_m1,x_m2,…x_mn}


		};
	
	- The name of an array is in fact a pointer to the first element of the array.  


    Characters
    - The most basic data type. It's simply a single character, and the memory requirement is typically a single byte of memory.
    - It should be known that all characters have an associated integer value. Some of these are:
    
        A = 65, B = 66...
        a = 97, b = 98...
	- Note: Given the 


    Strings
    - Strings are essentially an array of characters, held in between quotation marks. See the section below for the definition
    of an array. An example of a string would be:
    
        "My booney lies over the ocean"
        
    - Note: The blank spaces in string still count as characters. Moreover, the end of the string also contains a final character known as
    the string terminating character, which has a value of \0, and indicates the string length has been reached.
    - Declaration: To declare a string, there are two methods:
    
        1. char * string_name = "string";
        2. char string_name[] = "string";
        
    - The first declaration above means that the string is unalterable - you can't manipulate or change the individual string elements.
    The second declaration does allow the manipulation of the string, since its now an array variable. Note that we don't actually
    need to indicate the string length in the brackets, since the compiler does this automatically//On the other hand, for multi-dimensional
    arrays, which strings ARE NOT, we would have to specify the size of different elements//
    - The First Method: It should be noted that the first method actually creates a pointer variable, string_name, which points at the memory address of the first
    string element, "s". When the compiler reads this line, it allocates a memory address for each character in the string(1 byte per character) but also allocates
    4 bytes of memory for the address of the pointer itself. As we will see, this differs slightly from the second char declaration. It should be noted that the
    first method also allows for string assignment.
    - The Second Method: The second method creates an array of charaters. When the compiler reads the line, it allocates consecutive bytes of memory to the string(again, 1
    byte per character), and the name of the array, string_name, is associated with the address of the first string character. In fact, if you try to find the address
    of the string_name array name, it will be the same as the address of the first character. This is in contrast to the first method, where the pointer variable
    would have its own, separate memory allocation.
    - However, IT MUST BE NOTED that this second method means that the array name is a constant char pointer; it cannot be decremented
    or incremented, as it points at a constant memory location. Where it points cannot be assigned essentially, whereas on the other hand, the first method created
    a pointer variable, which CAN BE reassigned. 
    - /* A third method? Is given below:
    
        char s = "string"
        
    Here, the output and error messages from the debugger seem to indicate that s is automatically read as an array. /*No, this shouldn’t work, because we’re saying that s is a char type variable, it’s value is just a single character. 
    
    The exact error was cannot initialise a variable of type char with an lvalue of type const char [6]. 
    

        Pre-set string functions
        NOTE: To implement these functions, you have to include the #include <string.h> preprocessing directive. 
        - There are a number of in-built functions which can manipulate and use strings as arguments.
        - strlen: The first such function is strlen, which stands for string length, and 
        measures the length of the string. This can be implemented via the method below:
        
            strlen(string_name) or strlen("string")
            
        - The second is strncmp, which means string comparison, and compares the string to another string. This is used in lieu of
        the "==" operator for integers. This is implemented:
        
            strncmp(string_name, "string",n) or strncmp("string", string_name,n) or strncmp("string1", "string2",n)
            
        The function returns a value of 0 if the strings are the same, less than zero if the stopping character in the first parameter string has an integer value less than second, and vice versa.
	- Note that the "stopping character" referred to above is the nth character, in other words, the last character to be compared. 
	
	
        - Concatenation: The third function is strncat, which means string concatenation. This involves appending, ie adding, a piece
        of one string to THE END of another. This is implemented as follows:
        
            char dest[j];
            char src[k];
            strncat(dest, src, n);
            
        - In the above line of code, the strncat function takes three arguments - the destination string, the source string and n, the maximum
        number of characters to be appended from the source to destination.
        - NOTE: the string names don't actually have to be dest or src, these are just generic placeholder names.
        
        
        Array of pointers: With regards to page 245 of C through UNIX, it works because for a normal array of characters, we would have to create an array m[][n] where
        n represents the no.sub elements in the largest element of the array m. This means that, unless all the sub arrays are of the same size, there is a significant amount of memory
        wasted as the compiler sets the uninitialised values to the \0 value. On the other hand, we can create an array of pointers, char *p[], where each element  of the array
        points to the memory address of the first character of the sub-arrays. This means a lot of space is saved, as each element (p[0], p[1] etc) will only take up
        as much space as needed for all the characters and the values of the pointers themselves. 
        

Operators
	
	
	Relational Operators
	Relational operators in C return either a 1, for cases where the relation is true, or 0, for cases where the relation is false. 


	Suffix and prefix increment/decrement
	- Suffix increments/decrements use the current value of some variable in the expression, then increments/decrements it afterwards. Suffix increments are of the form:

		x++;

	Example:

		int x = 5, y =4;
		y = x++;
	
		/*y = 5 and x = 6 at the end, because x++ means we used the current value of x, 5, in the expression, so y == 5, and then incremented x afterwards, bringing its value to 6 */

	- Prefix increments/decrements increment/decrement the variable, and then uses the value in the expression. Prefix increments are of the form:

		++x;	

	For instance, we could have:
	
		int x = 2, y= 2;
		y = ++x;
		
		/*y now equals 3*/

	- A grand example: For example, we could have:

		int x,y,z;
		y = 2, z = 3;
		
		x = ++y + z++;
		printf(“The value of x, y and z respectively are: %d, %d, %d\n”,x,y,z);
			
		And this will output:

		“The value of x, y and z respectively are: 6, 2 and 4”

		HOWEVER, note that the reason x = 6 isn’t because our expression was 2 + 4, it’s because our expression was actually 3 + 3. This is because the postfix increment for z means that we used the current value of z, 3, in the expression, then incremented it, then we incremented the value of y from 2 to 3, and used that in the expression. 


Pointers
- Pointers are simply variables which hold the value of the memory address of something, rather than the value itself.
- Pointers are declared using the following notation:

    [pointer_type] * pointer_name = &the_variable_the_pointer_points_at
    
    This assigns a local variable called pointer_name and points to the memory address of the variable, array or string. 
    
- Pointer-String: As mentioned previously, all char * variable types are just pointers to string. 
- This allows us to exploit a handy property where we're able to actually manipulate the value of a variable through a function, rather than just the argument
passed into the function. This is because if we pass a variable into the function as an argument, and then the function does something to the argument, only the
argument will be changed, rather than the variable value itself.
- On the other hand, if we pass a pointer into the function, that is, the memory address of the variable, and then change the value of the argument (the pointer)
we're also changing the value of the variable, because our program recognises the memory address of the variable and changes the value at that address.


    Array of pointers
    An array of pointers can be initialised using the following syntax:
    
        [array_type] *[array name][] =
        
Scope
	- The idea of scope refers to how far reaching a variable is, or over what domain its value holds. 
	- The simple rule is: 
		1. If a variable is not declared within any given inner block of code (which includes functions), then its declaration and initialisation will come from some outer block of code (and if it hasn’t been declared and initialised in any outside block of code, there’s obviously an error). 
		2. If a variable is declared and/or initialised within some block of code, then the original variable name is temporarily hidden and unavailable until the block of code is exited, at which point the memory space used by the inner variable is freed. 
	- What the above rules mean is that if we have parallel 
	- By default, most variables declared within functions, e.g the main function, are local: this means that when they are declared, memory for the variable is allocated on the stack, then deallocated once the function is exited. 
	- So say for example you declare and initialise a variable i in main s.t:


		int i = 1;

	If you then declare and initialise a variable i in another function, say function_2, s.t:

		int i =  2;
	
	Then for function 2, whenever you use the variable i, it’s value will be counted as 2, not 1, since the scope of the variable i is local in both cases. However, if you were to declare a variable i outside of all functions, then this value will be used for all other functions without their own declaration of a variable i. 
	- In other words, given an identifier x, if a function has its own declaration of x as a variable, then it will use whatever value of that variable in the local scope was initialised as. If however, we have defined x as a variable outside of all functions, then all functions can access the value of x if they haven’t declared or initialised x in themselves. 
	- The user may also wonder, what if we declare a variable x inside a function and outside a function, but we only initialise the x outside the function? In such a case, we still adhere to the rule above: the local value of x will be used in the function since it has a declaration, and by empirical testing, it’s default value will be 0 if not explicitly initialised. 
	- One way of being able to use a variable declared outside of a function, including from another source file, is to use the method:

		extern [data_type] [variable_name];
	
	This means that further references to variable_name will use the value initialised to the variable outside of the function. 
	


Structures
- Structures are pretty much just objects and classes in C. 
- Structures can be declared in the following manner:

		(typedef) [struct] (struct_name) {


			[data_type1] [member_name];
			[data_type2] [member_name];
			.
			.
			.

		} (alias)[variable_names];


	- Here, note that we’ve put the typedef and struct_name as well as alias in ordinary parentheses to reflect the fact that they are optional. No matter what, we have to declare the block of code as a struct, but if we only declare it as a struct with no struct_name, we can’t initialise other variables to be of this struct type except those immediately after the braces. So, for example:

		struct {

			int val;

		} a1, a2, a3;

	Here, we initialise a1, a2 and a3 as being of type struct (i.e., they are structures with a single member, val). However, beyond these variables, we can’t declare another variable to be of the same struct unless we redeclare the struct code AGAIN. So, we can’t just go:


		struct a4 = malloc(sizeof(struct));

	A more sophisticated method of declaring structs would be:


		struct struct_name {

			int val;
		

		}struct1,struct2,struct3;


		struct struct_name struct4. = malloc(sizeof(struct_name));
		
		NOTE: If we don’t provide an alias, that is, we don’t do a typedef declaration, then when we declare new variables of the structure type, we have to use the notation


			struct struct_name


		
	We can become even more fancy by then giving the entire struct an alias (since we don’t want to type “struct” repeatedly in our declarations of new variables)


		typedef struct struct_name{

			int val;

		} alias_1;

		
		/*since we’ve said that alias_1 is also a stand-in for “struct struct_name”, this means we can use either alias_1 or “struct struct_name” in declarations. To illustrate: */

		struct struct_name * pointertostruct1 = malloc(sizeof(struct struct_name));
		alias_1 * pointertostruct2 = malloc(sizeof(alias_1));



	Memory: The memory size of a struct is, as far as we can tell, just the sum of the memory sizes of the data types contained within it.
